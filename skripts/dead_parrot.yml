- action: perform
  actor: Owner
  what: hits the cage
- action: speak
  actor: Owner
  line: There, he moved!
- action: speak
  actor: MrPraline
  line: No, he didn't, that was you hitting the cage!

  actor: MrPraline

  actor: MrPraline
  line: Now that's what I call a dead parrot.

- action: speak
  actor: MrPraline
  line: Um...now look...now look, mate, I've definitely 'ad enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased, and when I purchased it not 'alf an hour ago, you assured me that its total lack of movement was due to it bein' tired and shagged out following a prolonged squawk.
- action: speak
  actor: Owner
  line: Well, he's...he's, ah...probably pining for the fjords.
- action: speak
  actor: MrPraline
  line: PININ' for the FJORDS?!?!?!? What kind of talk is that?, look, why did he fall flat on his back the moment I got 'im home?
- action: speak
  actor: Owner
  line: The Norwegian Blue prefers keepin' on it's back! Remarkable bird, id'nit, squire? Lovely plumage!
- action: speak
  actor: MrPraline
  line: Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot when I got it home, and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been NAILED there.
- action: speak
  actor: Owner
  line: Well, o'course it was nailed there! If I hadn't nailed that bird down, it would have nuzzled up to those bars, bent 'em apart with its beak, and VOOM! Feeweeweewee!
- action: speak
  actor: MrPraline
  line: "\"VOOM\"?!? Mate, this bird wouldn't \"voom\" if you put four million volts through it! 'E's bleedin' demised!"
- action: speak
  actor: Owner
  line: No no! 'E's pining!
- action: speak
  actor: MrPraline
  line: "'E's not pinin'! 'E's passed on! This parrot is no more! He has ceased to be! 'E's expired and gone to meet 'is maker! 'E's a stiff! Bereft of life, 'e rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed 'im to the perch 'e'd be pushing up the daisies! 'Is metabolic processes are now 'istory! 'E's off the twig! 'E's kicked the bucket, 'e's shuffled off 'is mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisibile!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!!"
